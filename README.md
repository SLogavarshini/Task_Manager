# Task_Manager
The Task Manager website is a simple yet efficient web application that allows users to create, manage, and track their tasks directly in their browser. It utilizes local Chrome cache (LocalStorage) to store task data, ensuring that user entries persist even after refreshing or closing the browser.

The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a responsive and user-friendly interface. JavaScript handles task creation, editing, deletion, and status updates dynamically, while CSS ensures a clean and visually appealing design. Since the data is stored locally, the application works offline without requiring a backend or database.
